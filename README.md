checkmake-action is a third-party OSS Github Action for easy execution of [checkmake](https://github.com/mrtazz/checkmake).This action uses [cytopia/docker-checkmake](https://github.com/cytopia/docker-checkmake).

- **Rapid Container**
  - The checkmake-action employs a lightweight container based on [Alpile](https://hub.docker.com/r/cytopia/checkmake). In most cases, preparation to begin analysis takes less than 30 seconds in github-hosted runner.
- **Easy-to-use variable specification**
  - Wrapping command line arguments allows for more intuitive execution.
- **Can be embedded in CI**
  - You can Keep beautiful your Makefile every time.

## üóûÔ∏è Introduction

linter can make codes beautiful.However, there are relatively few instances of running linter against Makefile.We believe the cause of this problem is probably the complexity of preparing to run the linter for Makefile.

For this reason, we have created a Github action that makes it easy to run checkmake!

## üìö Usage

The following code is the minimum code to make checkmake-action work. In the following cases, checkmake is run with default settings.

```yaml
name: checkmake action
on:
  push:

jobs:
  checkmake:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: checkmake action
        uses: Uno-Takashi/checkmake-action@main
```

chackemake execution options can be passed as arguments. For example, to specify a file to be analyzed or to activate debug mode, do the following

```yaml
      - name: checkmake action
        uses: Uno-Takashi/checkmake-action@main
        with:
          makefile: "path/to/Makefile"
          debug: true
```

You can test it using GitHub-Hosted Runner. However, if you prefer to run your tests in a local environment, you can do so using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

```shell
act -W ./.github/workflows/test-my-self.yml
```
